# Simple-Weather-Forecasting-Application
Just a simple weather forecasting system with no graphics, no background. A simple one!

Developed a Weather forecasting application using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. The goal was to provide real-time weather updates for over 2,000+ cities with an impressive response time of under 200 milliseconds. To accomplish this, I focused on optimizing API calls and structuring the application for fast, reliable performance. Users can easily check current weather conditions, which enhances the application's practical use, especially for quick weather checks on the go. This project not only improved my understanding of API integration but also strengthened my skills in handling large datasets in real time.

### Example Interaction

```bash
Enter city name (or type 'exit' to quit): London

Weather in London:
Temperature: 12Â°C
Description: Light rain
Humidity: 85%
Wind Speed: 3.6 m/s

Enter city name (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the application. Goodbye!
